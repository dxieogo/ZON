# All Benchmarks

This repository now includes a consolidated benchmark file with the latest token analysis and a format comparison (JSON vs ZON vs TOON) for the `hikes` sample.

- Full analysis and raw output: `BENCHMARKS_ALL.md`
- Quick summary: ZON is smaller than TOON for the `hikes` example (22 bytes smaller, 8 tokens fewer using `o200k_base`).

If you want this text embedded into `README.md` or `zon-format/README.md`, I can insert the short summary sections there as well.
